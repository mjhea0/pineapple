##About
Bike tours around the five boroughs. 

#### 4 pages: Home - Tours - About - Essentials

The page is a responsive scroll. 

The landingpage (Home) will display a repeating gif image. 

User scrolls and sees 3 tour options.

The tours are images that have titles.

User selects a tour and is taken to a booking calendar. 
( I like what they're doing here and want to execute a similar calendar. http://www.getupandride.com/calendar/ )

The booking calendar will have 11 am and 4 pm options for all 7 days. The tours are 5 hours. The user books a tour. A database captures all the submitted information.

Once the booking is selected, the user will be taken to a payment page. Payment complete. 

The essentials page will display links to bike rental places if needed and necessary accessories for the ride. 


(There are more ideas I would like to incorporate into this app as it gets built. Essentially it'd be cool to have the calendar, get booking requests and send out confirmation emails with receipt and booking info.)
